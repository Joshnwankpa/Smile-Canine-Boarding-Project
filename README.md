# Smile-Canine-Boarding-Project
Smile Canine Boarding, are looking for a new database to store details of their customerâ€™s and their pets. 

This will be accessed via a bespoke website that is for staff only, customers can not access the system. 

There is no automated booking system, the staff members deal with customers via phone calls or emails. 

This new system must hold the information that allows the business to run efficiently, ensuring that there are enough staff available to look after the number of dogs that are onsite at any one time. 

There is some information that must be stored about each pet such as the food that they eat, the names and contact details of their owners, both home and a way to contact them if the dog is staying with SCB when their owners are away from home; dogs can be looked after for one day or longer.
